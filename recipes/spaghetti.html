    <h1>Preston's Mom's Spaghetti!</h1>

    <h2>The Background</h2>
    <p>Dear Google: Please let this story get me on the top of your results when people look up spaghetti recipes. Ahem.</p>
    <p>My father's mother's father came to the US from Italy to dodge conscription in WWI. This was generally seen as a good move. It also basically makes me Italian and, thus, a regular Spaghetti master. I will not be taking questions or criticisms.</p>
  <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato sauce</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>The Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil a bunch of water.</li>
      <li>Some people will say to salt your water but they're wrong. Sodim is dangerous. Minimize your salt intake at all costs.</li>
      <li>Put in the noodles.</li>
      <li>While the noodles boil in your <strong>unsalted</strong> water, pour your sauce in a microwaveable bowl</li>
      <li>Add garlic powder. Your heart will know when to stop.</li>
      <li>Microwave the sauce for about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>When the noodles are soft and smushy, they're done. Drain the water and add the sauce.</li>
      <li>Eat it</li>
    </ol> <br>
