    <h2>The Background</h2>
    <p>Let's be real here. It's 2022. Pizza delivery is thing. No one is making pizza at home. Why would you do that?</p>
    <p>Ordering pizza is going to be faster, easier, cheaper, and give you a much better final result. If you're googling how to make pizza, you need to re-examine yourself. Hemingway and your ancestors are judging you.</p>

      <li>A credit card</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to the Paisano's website.</li>
      <li>Just order whatever you want?</li>
